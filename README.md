# vue-project

Hi! Welcome to my humble abode. This is what I've came up with the task given to me. Everything was just written inside the `App.vue`. I tried to create custom renderers but my renderers won't render. I've read the documentation about custom renderers but I think their documentation for that is not easy to follow. However, I made the app possible because some things on their documentation were well-written.

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

npm run lint
```
